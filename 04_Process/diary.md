#  Process Diary

## A small note about a ginger cat - Tuesday 13 August, 11:17pm

In finally attempting to put this whole GitHub-as-process thing into practice, I created a repository and stuck my project in there. You can dig through all my stuff now, and I feel a little weird about it.

Godot did not enjoy this process, or I did something whacky as I shuffled files around, and somehow ended up with a file conflict that set some of my sprite work back a few steps. It's a small, if annoying, amount of work to redo, but it's the kind of thing that felt simple a week ago as I was teaching myself to use Libresprite, and now feels unbearable a week later. It's still simple, I just have to do it. 

In true fashion, I abandoned that task mid-flow and decided to boot this thing into existence. Now there's a diary. 

Now I need to learn something about Markdown. 

Now I need to take all those pages of notes I've written and retrospectively add them to the diary. 

...

So yeah, about the ginger cat.

On reloading the Fighters tilesheet into Godot and running the scene, I found myself staring at the first (second?) draft of the Knifefighter in all their black and grey fur glory. Thankfully I at least had the single frame of the ginger version, so I could quickly reconstruct the frames for the various animations.

Seeing the black/grey version though made me realise one of the points of this exercise was to keep track of my  design decisions. Like making the cat ginger to begin after feedback that this was easier to see against the background, and thinking further about how each Fighter needed some sort of distinct visual design. Besides being a cat.

The old sheet also reminded me of the momentary madness of removing a single layer of pixels to try and give an effect of the cat pawing away at a surface to get comfortable (is there an actual term for this?). In my head it looked cute. In reality it was a little distracting.

So the black and grey cat stays in the picture. It probably won't get used in the version for September, unless I really make headway on player skins. We'll save it for the Deluxe Edition.
