#  Process Diary

## A small note about a ginger cat - Tuesday 13 August, 10:59pm

In finally attempting to put this whole GitHub-as-process thing into practice, I created a repository and stuck my project in there. You can dig through all my stuff now, and I feel a little weird about it.

Godot did not enjoy this process, or I did something whacky as I shuffled files around, and somehow ended up with a file conflict that set some of my sprite work back a few steps. It's a small, if annoying, amount of work to redo, but it's the kind of thing that felt simple a week ago as I was teaching myself to use Libresprite, and now feels unbearable a week later. It's still simple, I just have to do it. 

In true fashion, I abandoned that task mid-flow and decided to boot this thing into existence. Now there's a diary. 

Now I need to learn something about Markdown. 

Now I need to take all those pages of notes I've written and retrospectively add them to the diary.
